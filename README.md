## Introduction

Hello! My name is Antony Macharia, and I'm excited to present my internship qualification project, the CEMA App. This project showcases my skills in Android app development, backend integration with Firebase Firestore, and my continuous learning mindset.

## Purpose of the Project

The CEMA App is designed to provide a convenient way for patients with chronic conditions such as HIV, diabetes, and hypertension to order medication remotely and manage their health needs. The app connects to a backend API and legacy database to facilitate seamless ordering and retrieval of medication information.
